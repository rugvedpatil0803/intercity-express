# IntercityExpress PART I

**The PART I Project has been done by G10**  
**_Vikas Sharma (23112042)_**  
**_Rugved Ajit Patil (23112026)_**  
**_Onkar Deepak Gangurde (23112010)_**  

**The Distribution for the PART I is as Follows:**  
_ER Diagram was initially drawn by each member of the group and after the common discussion we concluded to the attached ER Diagram below:_  

_The Relational Schemas was designed by three of us on the same day when we finalised the ER Diagram_  

_And the creation of database was also performed by three of us individually on our personnel computers and after getting the errors we jot them down and discussed them on another group meet_  

_In our project, we have 13 tables, for them each of us selected either four or five tables to get the sample data prepared for database_  

_For PART II of the Project, We have distributed the Sets as follows:_  
_Set A: Rugved Ajit Patil (23112026)_  
_Set B: Onkar Deepak Gangurde (23112010)_  
_Set C: Vikas Sharma (23112042)_  


**For IntercityExpress Project, the ER Diagram is as follows:**

Note: This ER Diagram is made using Lucidchart and paint.

**For IntercityExpress Project, the Relational Schemas are as follows:**  

Note: Bold means Primary Key.  
     Itallic means Foreign Key.  

1.	train (**t_id**, capacity, milage)
2.	stand_by(_station_id_, _t_id_)
3.	route (**r_id**, r_name, distance, time_taken, operation_days, arrival_time, departure_time)
4.	connects (_r_id_, _start_station_, _end_station_)
5.	schedule (**s_id**,_ r_id_, _t_id_, actual_departure_time, actual_arrival_time, date, _driver_, _co_driver_)
6.	station (**station_id**, s_name)
7.	staff (**staff_id**, st_name, contact_no, address, rest_days)
8.	maintainance (**mt_id**, m_type)
9.	goes_through (_t_id_, _mt_id_, date)
10.	travel Agent (**ta_id**, ta_name, commission)
11.	ticket (**ticket_id**, date, time, price, _r_id_)
12.	booking (_ticket_id_, _ta_id_, _p_id_, discount, final_price)
13.	passenger(**p_id**, p_name, p_age)
